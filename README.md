# beers
Should be a nice straight forward install for you. Need to enter both folders and do an NPM install
1. `cd server`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run dev` Can eventually set the port as process variable here (not fully implented in the client)
3. `cd ../beer-app`
4. `npm install`
5. `npm run serve`
